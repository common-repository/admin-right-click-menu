The default WP Admin Toolbar (frontend) is moved to a right click menu (context menu).

== Description ==

Useful for websites where the default Admin Toolbar is not fitting well into the design. Many website owners/clients show the their website to their customers from laptops that are also used for administration of the website and thus the experience is ruined by the black toolbar right in the top.

With Admin Right Click Menu you can still use the handy frontend admin shortcuts - e.g. **'Edit Page'** - just in a small fly-out menu. The menu is initially hidden but is activated by right clicking on user-defined element(s) on the website.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and drop the contents in wp-content/plugins/ folder of your WordPress installation and then activate the plugin from \'Plugins\' menu.

Go to **'Settings'** > **'Admin Right Click Menu'** for options.

The most important thing is to set a selector. You coud start by just typing in **body**
